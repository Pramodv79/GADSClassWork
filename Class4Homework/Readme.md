1. Command Line Tasks
    Look at the head and the tail of chipotle.tsv in the data subdirectory of this repo. Think for a minute about how the data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you think each row means? Tell me! (If you're unsure, look at more of the file contents.)
    <br>
    `head chipotle.tsv`
    <br>
    `Tail chipotle.tsv`
    <br>
    It is a tab seperated file with each row re-presenting items purchased. Multiple items within same order are listed as seperate rows. Order ID is linking them together. Each column provides more details about the item purchased
